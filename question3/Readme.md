# Question #2

Write a program that asks the user to input an integer, and tells the user whether the number is even or odd. Write a function called isEven() that returns true if an integer passed to it is even, and false otherwise. Use the modulus operator to test whether the integer parameter is even.

Hint: Youâ€™ll need to use if statements and the comparison operator (==) for this program. See lesson 4.9 -- Boolean values if you need a refresher on how to do this.

Your program should match the following output:

Enter an integer: 5
5 is odd
